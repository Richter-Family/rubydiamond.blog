__Based on a True Story__

Before I was even born, my parents decided to name me Ruby. They didn’t even see my brown hair, my blue eyes, and my body type yet. They just wanted a kid named Ruby, I think. I have a sister named Eva, and when I was born, she was all over me. I loved her attention nor I loved everyone’s attention. 

When I was a little girl, I remember everyone’s faces up in my face. They couldn’t take there big eyes off of me. I loved my life as a kid. I got almost everything I wanted, I just needed to say my cute please. I was a good kid, I wasn’t a spoiled demanding one, a polite one. Sure, I was a cry baby, but I always cried because of stupid things. I went to HJC for my pre-K, and my teachers were so nice. I loved everything about pre-K. There was dressing up, the cozy corner, and so much more! 

Though as I was growing up, in the fours my parents noticed something was wrong with me. I was so clumsy, I kept bumping into walls or tripping over things. My eyesight was horrible. They first took me to this doctor and he found out I had cataracts. I thought it was a life-or-death situation but it turned out I was fine, I just needed some surgery. My parent’s said that I could have the surgery in a few years when it grows worse, when I am 60 or even older! But, my crazy doctor insisted I had it then when I was only four years old. My parent’s agreed because they thought they could trust this doctor, but the doctor said I couldn’t cry, I couldn’t get wet and a bunch of other stupid rules. That doctor was no good so we went to a doctor all the way in Manhattan. 

The doctor was Dr. Lustig and he was a nice guy. He said I could have the surgery whenever I wanted, and I liked him. He was a funny doctor. After my visit to the eye doctor, he suggested a good subscription for me for glasses. I also needed to start wearing an eye patch due to my sensitive right eye. Kindergarten was a patch worse. 

I was doing some crazy gymnastics moves with my sister one night when suddenly I did one wrong and my fingers flopped. The morning after, my dad rushed me to the doctor and the doctor said I had a fraction in my two fingers. I was sad because my cast looked like loose toilet paper! But the teacher’s were way nicer to me then before so I quite enjoyed it. Now, first, second, and third grade were all good. Let’s skip to the good part in fourth grade!
