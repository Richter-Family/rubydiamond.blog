Once lived a girl named Tarry. Tarry’s favorite holiday was Christmas, she loved it! Even though it was just one day and not 8 nights, she was grateful for her presents she got, and was thankful that she got to spend the special holiday with her family. Tarry had a few friends she always sat with at lunch, worked with, and did much more with them. Tarry lived a good life with her parents. All though, she was an only child. She did have friends, but when she got home, her mom was at work, and her dad was just in the basement or at the kitchen table reading the newspaper. She tried telling her parents about getting a family pet, or maybe adopting a kid, but they never listened to her and thought she was just playing funny. One night, Tarry decided to speak up for herself. Tarry knew that she was never going to get a family pet, or a new sibling so she asked her parents for an Elf that she could put on her shelf. 

“You want an Elf for Christmas?” Tarry’s dad answered back with a scoff.

“Not for Christmas, just for Christmas decoration.” Tarry corrected smiling
Tarry’s parents looked at each other and sighed. But finally, Tarry’s mother spoke
“Fine, we’ll get you one tomorrow. But please, Christmas Eve is in three days, plan your Christmas list soon.” She exclaimed
Tarry nodded her head and ran up to her room with excitement! The next morning Tarry and her dad went to the Christmas store, and she ran into the Elf Aisle. She picked out the most expensive one she could find! Her dad looked at the price and his face turned as white as a ghost!
“Seriously Tarry? 65$ for an Elf? I’m getting you the 10 dollar one. Let’s go now.” He said taking the Elf and Tarry’s hand. Tarry was bummed, the expensive one had all these details but the one her dad wanted her to get was just a stupid normal Elf with a little evil smile. When Tarry got home, she put her Elf on the living room shelf.
“Are you going to name your Elf?” Her mother asks sipping her coffee
“I guess, I haven’t thought about the name yet. The Elf looks Male, he has Brown eyes, Brown hair and a green, white, and red outfit. I’ll name him Buddy!”
“Classic, maybe you and Buddy can start picking out what you want for Christmas.” Tarry’s mother said leaving the room and taking one more look at Buddy. That night, Tarry gave her Elf some hot chocolate to see if he would drink it. The next morning, when Tarry went to go look for her Elf, the hot chocolate cup was empty, and Buddy was gone! She looked all over for him but couldn’t find that Elf!
“Mom, Dad, where’s Buddy! Did you move him?”
“No, we thought you put him on the living room shelf?” The parent’s said shrugging
Tarry walked away in anger, when she sat down in her den she found her elf Buddy in back on the tv. Tarry thought it was just her parent’s tricking her so she just rolled her eyes and thought that the problem was over. The next night, she put Buddy on the living room shelf again left some Cookies out this time and went to sleep. But, the next morning instead of Tarry waking up to her alarm she heard her parent’s screaming. Tarry rushed downstairs to see what was going on, and to her horror, half the dishes were broken, everything was smashed and everything was all over the place in the kitchen. Buddy was on the kitchen table with the cookies half eaten! Tarry rubbed her eyes and thought it was a crazy dream, but it wasn’t
“I left the front door open last night, maybe an animal came in.” Tarry’s dad spoke
“Maybe, there are claw marks on the ground.” Tarry’s mother added. As the parent’s went on and on talking about and cleaning up the mess, Tarry knew what was happening
“Mom, Dad! It’s the Elf. Buddy is evil!” Tarry said loud and clear. The house was silent, and her parent’s looked furious
“Listen, when I say this, you’ll be mad at me but, there are no such thing as elves or Santa. It was just a wild animal. Now Tarry, stop looking at that Elf and help us clean!” Tarry’s dad said scolding her
Tarry was hurt by her dad’s words, but she was going to prove that buddy was real, and that he was a mean, mischievous Elf! The night before Christmas, Tarry set up cameras pointing straight at Buddy, she was determined to stop that Elf from ruining Christmas. In the morning, she was so excited to look at the tape. She watched the whole thing, but Buddy didn’t even move or touch his desert’s this time. She thought to herself, “This smart Elf” She decided to throw Buddy away, it was for the best. Who knows, maybe Buddy still is out there.
